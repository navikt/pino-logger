# @navikt/pino-logger

An simple logger that lets you log in your server runtime. Logs in a JSON format that [logs.adeo.no](https://logs.adeo.no) understands. And all logs are grouped under your application (`+application:yourapp`) with correct log level.

## Getting started

### Installation

```bash
yarn add @navikt/pino-logger pino
```

```bash
npm i @navikt/pino-logger pino
```

if you want to use the [team logs](https://docs.nais.io/observability/logging/how-to/team-logs), you also need to
install `pino-socket`:

```bash
yarn add pino-socket
```

```bash
npm i pino-socket
```

if you want to use the _**deprecated**_ secure logger (don't, use team logs), you also need to install `pino-roll`:

```bash
yarn add pino-roll
```

```bash
npm i pino-roll
```

### Step 1: Logging

Anywhere in your application where you want to log, you should import `import { logger } from '@navikt/pino-logger';`,
this is a [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/api.md#logger) instance, use it to log, for example:
`logger.warn("Uh oh")`.

Alternatively, if you need secure logging, use `ìmport { teamLogger } from '@navikt/pino-logger/team-logs';`.
See [Team Logs](#team-logs) for more information on secure logging.

### Step 2: pino-pretty

If you want pino-pretty for local development (and you probably do, simply install it and pipe it:

```bash
yarn add -D pino-pretty
```

```bash
npm i --save-dev pino-pretty
```

Simply pipe the output of your development server into pino pretty with correct message key:

```
"scripts": {
  "dev": "<your server> | pino-pretty --messageKey=message",
}
```

# @navikt/next-logger

An isomorphic logger that lets you log from both the frontend and the backend. Both will log in a JSON format
that [logs.adeo.no](https://logs.adeo.no) understands. And all logs are grouped under your application (`+application:yourapp`) with correct log level.

Now with [SecureLogs](https://doc.nais.io/observability/logging/how-to/enable-secure-logs/) support!

## Getting started

### Installation

```bash
yarn add @navikt/next-logger pino
```

```bash
npm i @navikt/next-logger pino
```

if you want to use the secure logger, you also need to install `pino-roll`:

```bash
yarn add pino-roll
```

```bash
npm i pino-roll
```

### Step 1: Prepare Next.js for isomorphic logging

You need an API route that will receive all the log statements from the frontend.

**For app dir:**

Create a new API route `/app/api/logger/route.ts`, it should look like this:

```ts
export { POST } from '@navikt/next-logger/app-dir'
```

**For pages dir:**

Create a new API route `/pages/api/logger.ts`, it should look like this:

```ts
export { loggingRoute as default } from '@navikt/next-logger/pages'
```

### Step 2: Logging

Anywhere in your application where you want to log, you should import `import { logger } from '@navikt/next-logger';`,
this is a [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/api.md#logger) instance, use it to log, for example:
`logger.warn("Uh oh")`.

Alternatively, if you need secure logging, use `ìmport { teamLogger } from '@navikt/next-logger/team-logs';`.
See [Team Logs](#team-logs) for more information on secure logging.

### Step 3: pino-pretty

If you want pino-pretty for local development (and you probably do, simply install it and pipe it:

```bash
yarn add -D pino-pretty
```

```bash
npm i --save-dev pino-pretty
```

Simply pipe the output of your development server into pino pretty:

```
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev | pino-pretty --messageKey=message",
}
```

### Step 4 (Optional): Integrating with [next-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-logger)

The pino configuration from this library can be shared with [next-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-logger).

Simply create a `next-logger.config.js` in the root of your project, and re-export the logging config as following:

```js
const { backendLogger } = require('@navikt/next-logger')

module.exports = {
    logger: backendLogger,
}
```

## Configuration

### App Dir

You want this configuration to execute as early as possible, but on the actual client. Typically in your app-dir app,
you will have for example a `<Providers>`-client that is `"use client"`-enabled.

On the _root_ of any `"use client"`-enabled file that wraps your root layout.tsx, you can configure the library, for
example:

```ts
"use client"

configureLogger({
    basePath: '/my/base/path',
})

export function MyProviders(): ReactElement {
   ...
}
```

### Pages

If your application is using a base path, or you want to have your logger on a different API-route, you can configure
the logger.

In your `_app.tsx`, on root in the file, you can use `configureLogger` as such:

```ts
configureLogger({
    basePath: '/my/base/path',
    apiPath: '/api/other-logger',
})
```

Or if you only want to change the base path:

```ts
configureLogger({
    basePath: '/my/base/path',
})
```

## Team Logs

If you want to log sensitive information, this will ship the logs to
nais' ["Team Logs"](https://docs.nais.io/observability/logging/how-to/team-logs/) instead of the default logs. This is
useful for logging sensitive information that you don't want to be publicly available.

See the [team log docs](https://docs.nais.io/observability/logging/how-to/team-logs/) for details on how to enable it
for your app.

This library uses the `pino-socket` library to send logs to the team logs over TCP to the nais' team log ingester.

Using team logger as an isomorphic logger requires an additonal API-route in your next app, the configuration is
similar to the primary logger route.

**For app dir:**

Create a new API route `/app/api/team-logger/route.ts`, it should look like this:

```ts
export { POST } from '@navikt/next-logger/team-log/app-dir'
```

**For pages dir:**

Create a new API route `/pages/api/team-logger.ts`, it should look like this:

```ts
export { pinoLoggingRoute as default } from '@navikt/next-logger/team-log/pages'
```

If you need to add some extra metadata to team log statements server side, you can add an metadata-middleware to
extract info from the request:

**App dir**

```ts
import { withMetadata } from '@navikt/next-logger/team-log/app-dir'
import { UAParser } from 'ua-parser-js'

export const POST = withMetadata((request) => {
    const userAgent = request.headers.get('user-agent')
    if (!userAgent) return { platform: 'unknown' }

    const ua = UAParser(userAgent)

    return {
        platform: ua.device.type ?? 'unknown',
    }
})
```

**Pages**

```ts
import { withMetadata } from '@navikt/next-logger/team-log/pages'
import { UAParser } from 'ua-parser-js'

export default withMetadata((req) => {
    const userAgent = request.headers.get('user-agent')
    if (!userAgent) return { platform: 'unknown' }

    const ua = UAParser(userAgent)

    return {
        platform: ua.device.type ?? 'unknown',
    }
})
```

Remember not to parse the body using `.json()` or `.text`!

This feature is available only for team-log and secure-log.

## Securelogs (Deprecated)

If you want to log sensitive information, you can use the `secureLogger` function. This will instead of logging to
stdout log to a file on /secure-logs.
This requires some setup, see [nais docs](https://doc.nais.io/observability/logging/how-to/enable-secure-logs/) for how
to enable secure logging in your app.

The log file is setup with [pino-roll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pino-roll) for rolling the logs based on file size.

For more details on how to configure the required API-routes for secure logging, see the team log section above, but
replace the imports with the secure logger imports.

Remember secure logs are being deprecated in favor of team logs, so you should not use this feature in new applications.

## Breaking changes: migrating from v1 to v2/v3

The only breaking change is that the paths for the API routes have been updated.

v2→v3 has no breaking changes, but changed how the library was built.

### App Dir

`app/api/logger/route.ts`:

```diff
- export { POSTLoggingRouteHandler as POST } from '@navikt/next-logger'
+ export { POST } from '@navikt/next-logger/app-dir'
```

### Pages

`pages/api/logger/route.ts`:

```diff
- export { pinoLoggingRoute as default } from '@navikt/next-logger'
+ export { loggingRoute as default } from '@navikt/next-logger/pages'
```

If you want to use the new secureLogger feature, refer to the Securelogs docs above.

## Breaking changes: migrating from v3 to v4

The only change is that the default message key is `message` instead of `msg`. This doesn't affect you
if you only view logs in Elastic, but if you have used some manual filters in Grafana (`{{ .msg }}`), you will need to
change it to `{{ .message }}`.

If you use `pino-pretty` you will also need to change the `--messageKey` option to `message` instead of `msg`.

```bash
"scripts": {
  "dev": "<dev> | pino-pretty --messageKey=message"
}
```
